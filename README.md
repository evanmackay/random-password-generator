[https://evanmackay.github.io/random-password-generator/](https://evanmackay.github.io/random-password-generator/)

This is a web application that allows the user to generate a random password.

## How it works

The website uses javascript to ask the user various questions to generate a random password for them. The user is asked to input the desired password length between 8 and 128 characters. Once they have don this, they are then asked which elements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) they would like to include in their password. Once completed, they will see a randomly generated password in the text area.
